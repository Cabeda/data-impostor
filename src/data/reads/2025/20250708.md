- Workflow: Prompt chainingPrompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see "gate‚Äù in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track.
- Workflow: RoutingRouting classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs.
- Workflow: ParallelizationLLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations:Sectioning: Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel.Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs.
- Workflow: Orchestrator-workersIn the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.
- Workflow: Evaluator-optimizerIn the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop.

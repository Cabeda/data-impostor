##### [Concurrency Control in Open Data Lakehouse | Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/01/28/concurrency-control/)

- cases where multiple writer jobs need to access the same table, Hudi supports multi-writer setups. This model allows disparate processes, such as multiple ingestion writers or a mix of ingestion and separate table service jobs to write concurrently.
- Apache Iceberg supports multiple concurrent writes through Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC). The most important part to note here is that Iceberg needs a catalog component to adhere to the ACID guarantees. Each writer assumes it is the only one making changes, generating new table metadata for its operation. When a writer completes its updates, it attempts to commit the changes by performing an atomic swap of the latest metadata.json file in the catalog, replacing the existing metadata file with the new one.

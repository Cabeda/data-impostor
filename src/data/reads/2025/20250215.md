- root-cause analysis (RCA)
- Slice and DiceThis approach finds clues for a metric movement by drilling down on specific segments within the metric; it has found successes at Pinterest, especially in diagnosing video metric regressions
- General SimilarityIn this approach, we look for clues of why a metric movement happened by scanning through other metrics and finding ones that have moved very “similarly” in the same time period, whether in the same direction (positive association) or in the opposite direction (negative association).
- practice, we have found that the first two factors, Pearson and Spearman’s rank correlations, work best because:p-values can be computed for both, which help to gauge statistical significanceboth have more natural support for measuring negative associations between two time-seriesnon-monotonic (e.g. quadratic) relationships, for which Pearson and Spearman’s rank correlations won’t apply, don’t tend to arise naturally so far in our use-cases / time window of analysis
- Experiment EffectsThis third approach looks for clues of why metric movements happened by looking at what a lot of internet companies have: experiments.
- For each control and treatment group in an experiment, we perform a Welch’s t-test on the treatment effect, which is robust in the sense that it supports unequal variances between control and treatment groups. To further combat noise in the results, we filter experiments by each experiment’s harmonic mean p-value of its treatment effects over each day in the given time period, which helps limit false positive rates. We also detect imbalances in control and treatment group sizes (i.e., when they are being ramped up at a different rate from each other) and filter out cases when that happens.

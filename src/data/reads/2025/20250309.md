- Let's recap the features of smallpond :Lazy evaluation with DAG-based execution – Operations are deferred until explicitly triggered.Flexible partitioning strategies – Supports hash, column-based, and row-based partitioning.Ray-powered distribution – Each task runs in its own DuckDB instance for parallel execution.Multiple storage layer options – Benchmarks have primarily been conducted using 3FS.Cluster management trade-off – Requires maintaining a compute cluster, though fully managed services like Anyscale can mitigate this.Potential 3FS overhead – Self-managing a 3FS cluster introduce significant additional complexity.

##### [Definite: Understanding smallpond and 3FS: A Clear Guide](https://www.definite.app/blog/smallpond)

- Smallpond’s distribution leverages Ray Core at the Python level, using partitions for scalability. Partitioning can be done manually, and Smallpond supports:

Hash partitioning (based on column values)
Even partitioning (by files or row counts)
Random shuffle partitioning

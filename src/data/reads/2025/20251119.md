##### [Thinking About Thinking With LLMs](https://davi.sh/blog/2025/09/thinking-with-llms/)

- In the case of this article, most people agreed that using LLMs to learn new things
needs to be done with some caution.

more people in conversation with computers.
- But I don’t think this changes the fundamental
reality that the best programmers aren’t the ones that make the widest use of the
highest abstractions. That’ll continue to be those who dig down and understand what’s
happening at a deeper level — that understanding will always lead to more deft use of any
tools that programmers have at their disposal.

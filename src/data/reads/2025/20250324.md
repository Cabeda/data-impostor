##### [Amazon Nova expands Tool Choice options for Converse API - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-nova-expands-tool-converse-api/)

- Auto leaves tool selection entirely to Nova’s discretion, whether to call a tool or generate text instead. Auto is useful in use cases like chatbots and assistants where you may need to ask the user for more information, and is the current default. 
            Any prompts Nova to return at least one tool call, from the list of tools specified, while allowing it to choose which tool to use. Any is particularly useful in machine to machine interactions where your downstream components may not understand natural language but might be able to parse a schema representation. 
            Tool enable developers to request a specific tool to be returned by Nova. Tool is particularly useful in forcing a structured output by having a tool that has the return type as your desired output schema.

- a joint study with the UK AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, we found that as few as 250 malicious documents can produce a "backdoor" vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume

- Automated testing. If your project has a robust, comprehensive and stable test suite agentic coding tools can fly with it. Without tests? Your agent might claim something works without having actually tested it at all, plus any new change could break an unrelated feature without you realizing it. Test-first development is particularly effective with agents that can iterate in a loop
- Write good documentation first and the model may be able to build the matching implementation from that input alone.
- A culture of code review. This one explains itself. If you’re fast and productive at code review you’re going to have a much better time working with LLMs than if you’d rather write code yourself than review the same thing written by someone (or something) else

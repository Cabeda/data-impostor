##### [The Commitment Inventory: Get More Done By Saying "No"](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/commitment-inventory)

- Important: When the timer goes off, start the next item immediately, even if you haven’t finished. Otherwise, you’ll get distracted, and your attention will lag
- I’m now working within a 50-minute “burst,” and I have 9:56 left before I have to move on to a different checklist within Pitches, so I am cranking out this draft much faster and with more focus than I otherwise would.If your resistance is high, start with a short burst, then add five as you go up.  Forster recommends keeping it under 40, but when I’m writing, I use 50-minute bursts. Adapt to fit your needs. When you lose momentum, go back to 5 minutes. You can use bursts for your breaks, too. In 8 minutes, when I finish this burst, I will get a cup of coffee, stretch my legs, pet my dog Duke, and maybe read a quick news article.  Forster recommends being strict with the timer, or your attention will drift.

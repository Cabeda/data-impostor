##### [Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)

- The first is manual testing. If you haven’t seen the code do the right thing yourself, that code doesn’t work. If it does turn out to work, that’s honestly just pure chance.
- Some changes are harder to demonstrate. It’s still your job to demonstrate them! Record a screen capture video and add that to the PR. Show your reviewers that the change you made actually works.
- The second step in proving a change works is automated testing. This is so much easier now that we have LLM tooling, which means there’s no excuse at all for skipping this step.
- When working on CSS changes I’ll often encourage my coding agent to take screenshots when it needs to check if the change it made had the desired effect.
- The human provides the accountability

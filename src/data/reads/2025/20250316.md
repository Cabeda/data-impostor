- LLMs can be harnessed for higher complexity problem-solving. By combining clever engineering with advanced prompting techniques, models could go beyond what few-shot learning could achieve. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was an early example of how models could interact with documents and retrieve factual information. LLMs can also can dynamically interact with a designated environment via tool calling. When combined with chain-of-thought prompting, these capabilities laid the foundation for what would later be known as AI agents.

- Three operational strategies are suggested: load shedding, auto-scaling, and fairness.
- token bucket, leaky bucket, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), fixed window, or sliding window.
- To avoid making the situation worse for a dependency that is under stress, AWS suggests two patterns for well-behaved clients: circuit breakers, preventing the sustained overload of a dependency, and retries, letting the client retry every request up to N times using exponential backoff with jitter between requests

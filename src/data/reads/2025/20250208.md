##### [Jujutsu VCS Introduction and Patterns by Kuba Martin](https://kubamartin.com/posts/introduction-to-the-jujutsu-vcs/)

- While in Git you generally organize your commits in branches, and a commit that’s not part of a branch is scarily called a “detached HEAD”, in jj it’s completely normal to work on changes that are not on branches. jj log is the main command to view the history and tree of changes, and will default to showing you a very reasonable set of changes that should be relevant to you right now - that is (more or less) any local mutable changes, as well as some additional changes for context (like the tip of your main branch).

- SMJ is the default and the most common join strategy for joining two large tables.
It is highly scalable and memory-safe due to its ability to spill sorted runs to disk. It is also robust to data skew as the shuffle phase redistributes data evenly across executors (especially when combined with Adaptive Query Execution AQE). However, it is computationally intensive due to the sorting step and incurs significant network I/O during the shuffle phase

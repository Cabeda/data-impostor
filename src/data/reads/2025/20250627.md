##### [Just make it scale: An Aurora DSQL story by Dr Werner Vogels - https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/05/just-make-it-scale-an-aurora-dsql-story.html)

- This doesn’t mean that Rust is right for every project. Modern Java implementations like JDK21 offer great performance that is more than enough for many services. The key is to make these decisions the same way you make other architectural choices: based on your specific requirements, your team’s capabilities, and your operational environment. If you’re building a service where tail latency is critical, Rust might be the right choice. But if you’re the only team using Rust in an organization standardized on Java, you need to carefully weigh that isolation cost. What matters is empowering your teams to make these choices thoughtfully, and supporting them as they learn, take risks, and occasionally need to revisit past decisions. That’s how you build for the long term.

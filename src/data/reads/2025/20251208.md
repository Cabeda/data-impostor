##### [How Tables Grew a Brain: Iceberg, Hudi, Delta, Paimon, DuckLake by Anton Borisov](https://medium.com/fresha-data-engineering/how-tables-grew-a-brain-iceberg-hudi-delta-paimon-ducklake-a617f34da6ce)

- The lake stops acting like a filesystem with extras and starts behaving like a database fronting an object store
- Choose your ride (intent over brand):Need stable, open analytics across engines? Start with Iceberg’s snapshot model.Need continuous upserts/deletes with low-lag views? Add Paimon/Hudi’s incremental/LSM ideas where it matters.Need multi-table ACID and fast planning? Move the brain into a catalog database (DuckLake-style).

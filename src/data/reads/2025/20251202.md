##### [Amazon CloudWatch incident reports now support Five Whys analysis](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/amazon-cloudwatch-incident-reports-five-whys-analysis/)

- The capability leverages both human input and AI-based analysis of incident data to recommends specific measures operators can take to prevent future occurrences and improve their operations.
- You can create an incident report by first creating a CloudWatch investigation and then clicking “Incident report”.

##### [PostgreSQL grouping sets: ROLLUP & CUBE by Hans-Jürgen Schönig](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-grouping-sets-rollup-cube/)

- ROLLUP is useful if you want to add the “bottom line”. However, you often want to see all combinations of countries and products. GROUP BY CUBE will do exactly that

##### [On Idempotency Keys - Gunnar Morling](https://www.morling.dev/blog/on-idempotency-keys/)

- We can somewhat improve this situation by adding a timestamp to the idempotency key, for instance by using a UUIDv7 which contains both a timestamp part (first 48 bits) and a random part (remaining bits), or an ULID. That way, the consumer can detect when it receives a message with an idempotency key which is "too old".
- All these intricacies can be avoided when it is possible to use a monotonically increasing sequence value as the idempotency key.
- log sequence numbers (LSN)
- For many scenarios, using UUIDs and dropping them after some time will probably be sufficient,
provided you can tolerate that messages occasionally can be processed a second time when duplicates arrive after the retention period of processed keys.
- The more messages you need to process overall,
the more attractive a solution centered around monotonically increasing sequences becomes,
as it allows for space-efficient duplicate detection and exclusion, no matter how many messages you have
- The proposed log-based approach can be an efficient solution for doing so,
but it also adds operational complexity:
your database needs to support logical replication,
you need to run a CDC connector, etc.
However, many organizations already operate CDC pipelines for other purposes
(analytics, search indexing, cache invalidation, etc.). If you’re in that category,
the incremental complexity is minimal

##### [Data-at-Rest Encryption in DuckDB by Lotte Felius, Hannes Mühleisen](https://duckdb.org/2025/11/19/encryption-in-duckdb)

- Starting with DuckDB 1.4.0, DuckDB supports transparent data encryption of data-at-rest using industry-standard AES encryption.
- The user itself is responsible for the key management and thus for using a secure key

##### [The Case Against pgvector | Alex Jacobs by Alex Jacobs](https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/)

- Each insert acquires locks on the graph structure. Under heavy write load, this becomes a bottleneck
- Pre-filter works great when the filter is highly selective (1,000 docs out of 10M). It works terribly when the filter isn’t selective—you’re still searching millions of vectors.
- Timescale has released pgvectorscale, which addresses some of these issues. It adds:StreamingDiskANN, a new search backend that’s more memory-efficientBetter support for incremental index buildsImproved filtering performance
- But here’s what I’ve learned: for most teams, especially small teams, dedicated vector databases are actually simpler
- Index management is hard. Rebuilds are memory-intensive, time-consuming, and disruptive. Plan for this from day one
- Query planning matters. Filtered vector search is a different beast than traditional queries, and Postgres’s planner wasn’t built for this.
- Real-time indexing has costs. Either in memory, in search quality, or in engineering time to manage it.

##### [Measuring what matters: How offline evaluation of GitHub MCP Server works by Ksenia Bobrova](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/measuring-what-matters-how-offline-evaluation-of-github-mcp-server-works/)

- Offline evaluation catches regressions before users see them and keeps the feedback loop short, so we can ship changes that genuinely improve performance

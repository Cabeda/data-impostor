##### [Stacked Diffs with `git rebase --onto` by Dinesh Pandiyan](https://dineshpandiyan.com/blog/stacked-diffs-with-rebase-onto/)

- Stacked diffs solve this by breaking your work into smaller, dependent PRs:
- git rebase --onto <new-base> <old-base> <branch>
                      ↑          ↑          ↑
                new parent  old parent   branch to rebase
- The marker branch pattern takes the guesswork out of tracking the old base. Use it, update it, and your stacked diffs will stay clean.
- Force pushes are required: Every rebase changes commit hashes, so you’ll be doing git push --force-with-lease a lot.
- Marker branches need discipline: If you forget to update your marker, your next sync will be painful. Consider aliasing the full command:
1alias gsync='git rebase --onto $1 $2-base $2 && git branch -f $2-base $1'
- Merge conflicts multiply: If you have conflicts when rebasing feature-1, you might hit them again when rebasing feature-2. That’s the nature of the beast.
- Don’t stack too deep: Two or three levels is manageable. Beyond that, the maintenance overhead outweighs the benefits. I personally try to keep it at 2 levels max.

- Data Compaction Avoidance: DuckLake requires far fewer compaction operations than comparable formats. DuckLake supports efficient compaction of snapshots.
- changes to the data, DuckLake can optionally use the catalog database to store those small changes directly to avoid writing many small files.

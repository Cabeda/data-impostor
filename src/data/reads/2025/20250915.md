##### [Iceberg, The Right Idea - The Wrong Spec](https://database-doctor.com/posts/iceberg-is-wrong-2.html)

- Iceberg suffers from many problems, it:

Uses O(n) operations to add new metadata to an existing table - where it should have used O(1) or O(log(n))
Cannot handle cross table commits
Relies on file formats that are bloated and ineffective
Tries to be a "file only" format, but still needs a database to operate
Does not handle fragmentation and metadata bloat and remains silent about the real complexities of that problem
Does not handle row level security or security at all for that matter
Fundamentally does not scale - because it uses a bad, optimistic concurrency model
Is entirely unfit for trickle feeding of data - a hallmark feature of large Data Lakes
Moves an extraordinary amount of complexity (and trust) to the client talking to it
Makes proper caching and query planning (the hallmarks of good analytics) very difficult, if not impossible
Has all the hallmarks of something being designed by committee, completely lacking elegance

##### [Amazon Adds A2A Protocol to Bedrock AgentCore for Interoperable Multi-Agent Workflows by Vinod Goje](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/11/a2a-amazon-bedrock-agentcore/)

- Amazon announced support for the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, enabling communication between agents built on different frameworks. The protocol allows agents developed with Strands Agents, OpenAI Agents SDK, LangGraph, Google ADK, or Claude Agents SDK
- Agentic systems require several foundational components to operate effectively. Memory functions at two levels: short-term memory maintains conversation context within active sessions, while long-term memory retains insights across multiple sessions over time
- MCP solves the agent-to-resource connection problem, while A2A solves the agent-to-agent communication problem in multi-agent deployments.
- The A2A protocol's stateful behavior lets agents remember recent interactions and maintain coherent conversations. Session smuggling attack exploits this property to inject malicious instructions into a conversation, hiding them among otherwise benign client requests and server responses.

##### [Demystifying Determinism in Durable Execution](https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/11/24/demystifying-determinism-in-durable-execution)

- function that performs some side effects, such as writing to a database, making an API call, sending an email etc, and makes it reliable via recovery (which in turn depends on durability).
- This becomes equivalent to jumping to the first unexecuted step and resuming from there.
- Re-execution of the control flow requires determinism: it must execute based on the same decision state every single time and it must also pass the same arguments to side effect code every single time. However, side effects themselves do not need to be deterministic, they only require idempotency or duplication tolerance.
- The side effects absolutely can and should be non-deterministic, which is fine because they should generally only be executed once, even if the function itself is executed many times. For those failure cases where the result is not durably stored, we rely on idempotency or duplication tolerance.

##### [You Should Write An Agent](https://fly.io/blog/everyone-write-an-agent/)

- Take “sub-agents”. People make a huge deal out of Claude Code’s sub-agents, but you can see now how trivial they are to implement: just a new context array, another call to the model. Give each call different tools. Make sub-agents talk to each other, summarize each other, collate and aggregate. Build tree structures out of them. Feed them back through the LLM to summarize them as a form of on-the-fly compression, whatever you like.

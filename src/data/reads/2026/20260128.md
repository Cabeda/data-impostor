##### [Tips for getting coding agents to write good Python tests by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/26/tests/)
##### [Why Stoicism is one of the best mind-hacks ever devised by Lary Wallace](https://aeon.co/essays/why-stoicism-is-one-of-the-best-mind-hacks-ever-devised)

- Only by envisioning the bad can we truly appreciate the good; gratitude does not arrive when we take things for granted. It’s precisely this gratitude that leaves us content to cede control of what the world has already removed from our control anyway.

##### [AI’s trillion-dollar opportunity: Context graphs by Ashu Garg, Jaya Gupta](https://foundationcapital.com/context-graphs-ais-trillion-dollar-opportunity/)

- We call the accumulated structure formed by those traces a context graph: not “the model’s chain-of-thought,” but a living record of decision traces stitched across entities and time so precedent becomes searchable. Over time, that context graph becomes the real source of truth for autonomy – because it explains not just what happened, but why it was allowed to happen.
- Once you have decision records, the “why” becomes first-class data. Over time, these records naturally form a context graph: the entities the business already cares about (accounts, renewals, tickets, incidents, policies, approvers, agent runs) connected by decision events (the moments that matter) and “why” links. Companies can now audit and debug autonomy and turn exceptions into precedent instead of re-learning the same edge case in Slack every quarter.
- The orchestration layer sees the full picture: what inputs were gathered, what policies applied, what exceptions were granted, and why. Because it’s executing the workflow, it can capture that context at decision time – not after the fact via ETL, but in the moment, as a first-class record.



That’s the context graph, and that will be the single most valuable asset for companies in the era of AI.
- High headcount. If a company has 50 people doing a workflow manually (routing tickets, triaging requests, or reconciling data between systems), that’s a signal. The labor exists because the decision logic is too complex to automate with traditional tooling.

##### [Memory: How Agents Learn](https://www.ashpreetbedi.com/articles/memory)

- Here's the dirty secret: when building agents with the API, we've made them capable, but we haven't yet figured out how to make them learn.
- Pattern 1: Session Memory
Store messages in a database, retrieve them before every response, add them to the context. Agno gives you this out of the box — just give your agent a database.
- Pattern 2: User Memory
Remember facts about the user across sessions. The MemoryManager extracts preferences automatically and stores them in the database.
- Pattern 3: Learned Memory
Now let's add learned memory: insights that apply beyond just one user. The key is a custom tool that saves learnings to a knowledge base
- The quality of your knowledge base determines the quality of learning. Garbage in, garbage out.
The solution: the agent proposes learnings, but only saves with explicit user approval.
- A learning is worth saving if it's:

Specific: "Tech P/E ratios typically range 20-35x" not "P/E varies"
Actionable: Can be applied to future queries
Generalizable: Useful beyond this one conversation

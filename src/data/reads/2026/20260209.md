- Pattern 4: Debuggability will win over complexity



Developers will adopt agentic patterns that are transparent, auditable, and diff-based—not opaque systems that act without visibility.

- The participants who showed stronger mastery used AI assistance not just to produce code but to build comprehension while doing so—whether by asking follow-up questions, requesting explanations, or posing conceptual questions while coding independently.
- w. It is possible that AI both accelerates productivity on well-developed skills and hinders the acquisition of new ones, though more research is needed to understand this relationship.

##### [AI Doesn’t Reduce Work—It Intensifies It by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/9/ai-intensifies-work/)
##### [AI fatigue is real and nobody talks about it by Siddhant Khare](https://siddhantkhare.com/writing/ai-fatigue-is-real)

- Before AI, I might spend a full day on one design problem. I'd sketch on paper, think in the shower, go for a walk, come back with clarity. The pace was slow but the cognitive load was manageable. One problem. One day. Deep focus.
Now? I might touch six different problems in a day. Each one "only takes an hour with AI." But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain. The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.
- The cruel irony is that AI-generated code requires more careful review than human-written code.
- If we can't review everything AI produces - and we can't, not at scale - then we need systems that constrain what agents can do in the first place.
- The engineers I've talked to who handle this best are the ones who've made peace with it. They treat AI output like a first draft from a smart but unreliable intern. They expect to rewrite 30% of it. They budget time for that rewriting. They don't get frustrated when the output is wrong because they never expected it to be right. They expected it to be useful. There's a difference
- . I now treat every AI output as a rough draft. A starting point. Raw material. I mentally label it "draft" the moment it appears, and that framing change alone reduced my frustration by half.
- 'd been outsourcing my first-draft thinking to AI for so long that my ability to think from scratch had degraded.

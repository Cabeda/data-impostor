## Things I've done this week

- Presented the impact of gender bias at Volkswagen Digital Solutions
- Moved to Denmark ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°

## Reflections on the past week

- Well, I'd say this last week was one of growth. Didn't get much done project wise but can't feel bad since I've had to prepare as much as possible of my wedding before moving to Denmark. The presentation to Volkswagen Digital Solutions was done to a small group but really liked the discussion we had. More to come! I've also gotten to focus on fixing some of the usability issues I had with the audibook generator which I'm planning on releasing as a frontend application this week. Somehow ğŸ˜…

I'm also getting a few ideas I'd like to test out. As I'm on the AI team we are getting lots of requests that require reading not well strcuture files like PDF's power points and so on. I think to take a better look into it and I'm planning on testing a local setup with duckdb and an AI framework.

But first I need to visit the new city I'm at.

## Next week's plan

- Get to know the city
- Deploy the audiobooks generator (v 0.0.1)
- Trim to 0 my readeck list (50 and > 10h of reading ğŸ˜…)

See you next week!

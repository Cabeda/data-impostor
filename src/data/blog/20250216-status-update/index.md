## Things I've done this week

- Maintained consistency with my TODO list for the second straight week. After years of trying, I'm seeing incremental improvements
- Updated the blog to Astro 5.3, resulting in performance improvements
- Created two issues for the Readeck project. Would love to contribute a PR once I improve my GO knowledge
- Received approval for my article publication on the VDS blog
- Completed reading "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning". Need to compile notes and write an article implementing the key action items

## Reflections on the past week

I've adapted my reading approach by:

- Using eleven reader for audio consumption
- Taking notes directly on Kindle
- Successfully completing the book despite time constraints

However, I had to deprioritize the BAT-POS project in favor of writing the blog post about data loading to Glue. My current focus is on deepening my understanding of this topic to produce a comprehensive article.

## Next week's plan

Monday:

- Compile and organize notes from "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning"
- Begin blog post on data loading to Glue tables using Python (focusing on AWS Data Wrangler and Ibis)

Tuesday:

- Continue work on Glue-related blog post
- Draft the next VDS article

Thursday to Saturday:

- BONUS: Dedicate focused time to the BAT-POS project development

See you next week!

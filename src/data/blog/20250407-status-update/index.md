## Things I've done this week

- Got to know Aarhus, the library is amazing!
- Got a functioning audiobook generator but I'm taking a step back to define a roadmap
- Trimmed not to 0 but to 28 articles, most in the last 2 days. So just 7 hours of reading
- Started a paper reading club
- Started reading this month's book "Pragmatic programmer"

## Reflections on the past week

Aside from the surprising sun in Denmark, it's been great to work in a foreign country for more than a couple of days. I even took the opportunity to visit an work from the dokk1. These are truly social hubs and I'm in love with the concept. But I also got a lot of work done for VDS which I'm feeling that we can improve a lot in the next months.
For this week I'm hoping on getting a lot of reading done (an entire book) while taking some minutes to define what I'd like to see in an audiobook generator. I'm thinking that a package would be the best way to have it shared. Then I can focus on setting a frontend for it. The thing is that I'd like to have it run locally as an option. I can't pay the costs for many people and they might just want something that they can leave running on their computer for the day. But I'd also love to add more features to the tool. How could I add a translation to the book? And allow to interpret images or have AI help detect the best way to voice tables? These are really interesting questions. Because as time passes I feel I'd like to take less time looking into a monitor and more time listening. Wihthout fear of missing something. Let's see how it goes

## Next week's plan

- Define a roadmap for the audiobook generator
- Setup a quick poc of reading PDF's and getting a rag setup with ollama
- Define the paper for this week
- Getting to know copenhagen and Malm√∂

See you next week!

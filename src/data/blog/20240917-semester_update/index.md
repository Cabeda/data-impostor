With impostor syndrome hitting hard I've decided to dedicate each week to write on a specific topic. I'll be picking on the topic each Friday and deep dive into it during the week with the goal of publishing it on the next Thursday. This will be my main focus for the semester starting on the end of October right after I've finished the AWS exam (postponed due to a bike accident).

Some of the topics I'm interesting in deep diving:

- Spark and pyspark
- AWS Glue
- Apache iceberg using AWS Glue
- Data quality frameworks
- ML Ops

## Goal

I'll try to be more present in the community and share my learnings. This means researching and writing on the topic at hand and either present it to my team, a friend or even the community. If the topic is interesting and requires it I might take an additional week to finish it.

## Semester update

I'll also be writing an article on the conclusion of another one of my semesters after the AWS exam. I've decided to move the readings to a separate section as at the moment I look at the page as a resource to find articles I found useful.

## Things I've done this week

- Migrated my team randomizer from create-react-app to Vite (tr.cabeda.dev)
- Fixed the audiobook generator to deploy a working audiobook for mp3, m4a and m4b. It's actually neat but I need to clean it up
- Got something working for translation of epubs to another language. It's a bit hacky as I'm focusing on using local models but it's a start. I've seen a nice demo for [swedish books](https://github.com/cubbK/ereader-swedish/tree/main/ereader) but as it's using a cloud model, it's not scalable for me.
- Started reading the Invisible women. Got 1 part read ðŸ’ª
- Started to migrate some of my notion pages to Anytype. Taking a closer look into #madeinEU ðŸ‘€

## Reflections on the past week

Funny how I seem to be able to get a lot done but not much related to the work I wanted to do ðŸ˜… I've gotten a few words on the article but the work takes most of the time, I keep personal projects to do on open time and give priority to family and friends. With Fridays and Saturday mornings taken for the week's reading there's not much left, which I use to listen to a few Nebula/Youtube channels I follow.

As I write this I see I need to focus. I'll prioritize my SMART goals definition and reading the next book which I'll present at the end of the month.

## Next week's plan

- Compile and organize notes from "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning"
- Read the Invisible Woman

See you next week!

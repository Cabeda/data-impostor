## Things I've done this (2) week(s)

- Migrated to a new Mac
- Read and prepared presentation for Invisible Women

## Reflections on the past week

- I've gotten a busy week in Lisbon and gotten a lot done with my team. I'm lagging a bit on the articles read (28). At least 3 are papers which should take me a bit of time. I'll try to catch up on these during the week. Getting also ready to go out of the country for a couple of months (Denmark) so this week I'm focusing on getting everything in order before I leave.

## Next week's plan

- Present Invisble women
- Finalize travel arrangements and prepare for the upcoming months

See you next week!

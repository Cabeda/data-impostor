This past week I've had the opportunity to talk for Volkswagen's internal tech summit ([slides]((/slides/test.html))) about how we can use SQL on our day-to-day. It was great to give a talk outside Porto and for sure I'll be looking into presenting another one this year. With that said I have a personal project that I'll be focusing on for the next weeks. I'm considering using gpt4O as the basis. If all goes well it might be enough for a conference talk!

## Readings

- [What’s New In Python 3.13 — Python 3.13.0b1 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html): We are getting a JIT compiler! And Python now works on iOS?
- [James Shore: A Useful Productivity Measure?](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2024/a-useful-productivity-measure): Value add looks exactly like I feel working. A powerful metric that can easily be cheated upon. So you see who is responsible when given the freedom
- [Node.js 22 Released with Increased Support for ESM Modules and Web APIs - InfoQ by Bruno Couriol](https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/05/node-22-released/): Nice to see improvements in the move to ESM modules
- [AI Copilots Are Changing How Coding Is Taught - IEEE Spectrum by Rina Diane Caballar](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-coding)
- [A few facts about POSIX - Vorakl's notes](https://vorakl.com/articles/posix/): Very good technical and historical insight into Posix
- [Introducing Amazon Q data integration in AWS Glue | AWS Big Data Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-amazon-q-data-integration-in-aws-glue/)
- [Dynamic DAG generation with YAML and DAG Factory in Amazon MWAA | AWS Big Data Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/dynamic-dag-generation-with-yaml-and-dag-factory-in-amazon-mwaa/): test
- [dbt at Zendesk — Part 2: supercharging dbt with Dynamic Stage | by Vasilii Surov | Zendesk Engineering by Vasilii Surov](https://zendesk.engineering/dbt-at-zendesk-part-2-supercharging-dbt-with-dynamic-stage-4703a49d1c30): Interesting take on how to deploy dbt. Note that this is mostly used in places where we have data warehouses. With the introduction of data lakes on top of s3 is there a major difference?
- [Enabling near real-time data analytics on the data lake](https://engineering.grab.com/enabling-near-realtime-data-analytics?ref=blef.fr)

I've gotten focused on the presentation for VWDS as well as on reading a bit of fantasy. [The will of the many](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58416952-the-will-of-the-many) is a top contender for my book of the year.

## Goals

- Trim on the reading list
- Deliver demo with gpt4O + UI

## Reflections on the past (2) week(s)

TLDR:

- Setup tailscale + jellyfin
- Finished the pragmatic programmer book
- Finished reading the radar from thoughtworks
- Finished reading the graphrag paper

In terms of coding. There was almost none. Unless you don't count me setting up tailscale + jellyfin to access my media library from anywhere. It was a fun project and compared to the cloudflare setup was really easy. Got me excited to try and setup immich for self-hosted storage. However I want to setup a backup plan using hetzner before moving completely to this solution. But I'm thinking that if I get everything working and get a cheap backup plan to hetzner that I might actually spare some changes. Specially if I count this for both me and fiancee.

Ahhh, I also kinda focused on finishing the pragmatic programmer book. It's been an eye opener to me. Suddenly I understand what are the good qualities I've seen in people I look up to. The midnset to always be learning and improving. To be humble and test lot's of things. To test and automate. To be a good communiticator and a team player. These are all written ideas on the book.

Frankly, the book club has been really good to me. I already got good insights that I need to write down and apply throughout my life.

## Next week's plan

I'm taking this week to organize the next projects. One thing I've noted is that it's important to write down the projects I want to do but I haven't gotten the long terms goals set as proposed on the pragmatic thinking book. Need to revise and adapt the semester goals.

Focus mean taking one thing at a time. And looking back into the past weeks I see that I tend to have multiple projects which tend to be a bit overwhelming. Let's see if less is more.

See you next week!

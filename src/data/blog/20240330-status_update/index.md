So it's been a short time since the last update. I'm still trying to focus on the AWS Data Engineer course (Udemy). All other series and readings are done when doing chores or doing sport activities.

However I'm very keen on testing some coding projects to test ideas and learn a bit more. Still want to get a bit of time to optimize parquet compaction of data on S3.

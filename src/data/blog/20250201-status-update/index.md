## Things I've done this week

- Pivoted on the wedding invite design. Going to build something to print instead of a website
- Created an audiobook generator using kokoro.js, deno and ffmpeg. A bit hacky but I'm trying to improve the text and title retrieval. And possibly use an sml to get better titles. I'm intending on using for personal usage only but would like to eventually run it as a service.

## Next week

- I'll help pivot an existing app at my team
- I'll be working a bit on MLOps, possibly going to read a bit about flyte, metaflow and zenml
- I'll improve the audiobook generator script to be more reliable between epubs
- I'll build the design of the wedding invitation (possibly using good old Word ðŸ˜…)
- And, if feeling a bit fancy, might get around to migrating the BAT-POS to postgres

See you next week!

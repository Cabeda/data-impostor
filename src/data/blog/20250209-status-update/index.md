## Things I've done this week

- Created a monogram for my wedding. Ended up using Figma, exporting to PNG. My brother did most of the work exporting to STl file to 3d print a stamp. Seeing how well it goes.
- Successfully planned the next steps for a project at work. [The talk Why Most Machine Learning Projects Fail to Reach Production and How to Beat the Odds](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/ml-pitfalls/) seems very relevant to the project
- Successfuly cleaned my reading list to 0
- Read "As Causas do Atraso PortuguÃªs". Really nice take on my home country main issues

## Reflections on the past week

- Happy with the progress at VDS. Going to be two exciting weeks ahead
- A bit sad that I couldn't advance on the BAT-POS project. I'd love to pick on the epubs project but I need to have my priorities straight

## Next week

- Finalize the wedding invite design
- Read the next book for my company's book clubs: "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware"
- Have a working solution of BAT-POS on top of supabase instance. Gonna replicate the database schema and create a new database class to handle all connections.

See you next week!

So for the second week I've been taking care to map my day life into the calendar. Funnily enough, I got to read [How Do You Spend Your Time? - Marc's Blog by Marc Brooker](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/02/06/time.html) which states a bit the idea I was starting to map in my head. There will never be a "perfect week" but if we don't measure we can't know where we might me lacking.

So, now I have created the following calendars:

- General: self leisure time and others
- Code: For side projects
- Reading: Getting through my reading list
- Cooking: a man gotta eat
- Social: d&d, eating out, being with friends, etc
- Deep Work: the actual work, coding, documenting, and so forth (not counting the work meetings)
- Workout: exercise is good for my health

Looking at the list above it would be perfect to have a script to get a summary of a given time window (something to do later). For now I'm quite happy I got to set time boundaries for reading (my reading list as really gotten down). For next week I'll be trying to map the hours here to get a self review of how I could improve, for now I've set the work.

With this said, I haven't gotten anything done for the AWS Certification this week. I'll be sure to get more done instead of only reading articles.

## Readings of the week

So, after a lot of reading (around 8h this week) I got to 5 to read article on omnivore. If I keep this down I guess I can finnaly get to read the Pandas docummentation.

## Reflections

I've gotten a bit of work done on the BAT-POS to have it prepared for the next event. For the next month, I'll be getting more involved to ensure everything runs smoothly without my direct intervention. But my first priority for today is to have a dbt presentation. My goal is to have a good enough draft and then iterate on it to have something to present at a meetup.

During the week I'll also be reading a paper on Search-r1 and hope to have a proposal on TTS for Readeck. It's something I've wanted to help speed up my readings and with the help of Copilot I think I can get something working and clear. Which, by the way, are at zero on Readeck which I hope will free me to do a bit more for the rest of the week!

As not everything needs to be technical, I'm coming back to Portugal and looking forward to learning a bit more about the Daggerheart RPG and how to use it. Would love to be the GM for a session.

## Current Week Plan

- Prepare dbt presentation
- Read Search-r1 paper
- Create MR with TTS for Readeck


See you next week!

## Things I've done this week

- Gotten a lot of hours working on Ibis, it's proving as an interesting tool and I'll be doing a bit more with it
- Moved today to Todoist, let's see how it goes. I might also consider using an open source solution like Vikunja
- Finished the draft on my wedding invitation ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- Tinkered with the epub-to-audiobook converter. I've gotten it to correctly parse and extract but there's a bug somewhere where it doesn't separate the audiobook into chapters.

## Reflections on the past week

- This week has been spent a lot on socializing. I've set a rule of avoiding saying no to social events and it's been a good experience so far. However, this led to not being able to advance much on personal projects. With the close of the book "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning" I'll definitely need to rethink my goals for the next 2 to 5 years and measure its progress. So, I'd set the goals as:
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Semester
  - Yearly
  - 2 to 5 years

## Next week's plan

- Begin blog post on data loading to Glue tables using Python (focusing on AWS Data Wrangler and Ibis)
- Compile and organize notes from "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning"

- BONUS: Of course, dedicate time to the BAT-POS project development

See you next week!

With impostor syndrome hitting hard I've decided to dedicate each week to write on a specific topic. I'll be picking on the topic each Friday and deep dive into it during the week with the goal of publishing it on the next Thursday. This will be my main focus for the semester starting on the end of September right after I've finished the AWS exam (postponed due to a bike accident).

Some of the topics I'm interesting in deep diving:

- Spark and pyspark
- AWS Glue
- Apache iceberg using aws Glue
- Data quality frameworks
- ML Ops

I'll try to be more present in the community and share my learnings. Hopefully until the end of the year I'll be more confident on my writing skills and have a good set of articles. To help increase the articles quality I might have to ask for some help from friends and colleagues.

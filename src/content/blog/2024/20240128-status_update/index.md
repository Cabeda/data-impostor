For this week, I've spent it on reading. Below I got a list of 45 articles of highlighted videos and articles (basically cleaned the omnivore saves of last year). My main topics are AWS, Python, Spark as well as a bit of AI as this is the main focus of my work. The subjects are quite motivating for me although I have the constant feeling that the Web folk have it much better. The podcasts are great, the documentation is top notch and the quick iteration of tools makes for a healthy competition that in the ends helps the developers.

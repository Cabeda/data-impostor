## Semester 1 last update

So, with almost the close of the semester this will be the last update. The next article will be about reviewing how the semester 1 went and planning the next one. I'm quite excited about it.

## Web Dev

Progress: 10%

I guess having migrated from gatsbyJS to Astro counts for somethings. However I think this subject as been a bit of a fluke. As I said above, I've wanted to do two things at the same time to no avail. And not having a clear objective didn't help.

## Code challenges

Progress: 34%

Since the last update, I've only gotten to day 10. The presentation has taken it's time to prepare. However, to close this semester I want to get through the entire exercises. I'm switching between the challenges, writing and the presentation when fed up (and all other things in my life).

## Data Stream

Progress: 80%

I've been training the presentation for January 10th. It's a bit maddening to try and get everything done in 20 minutes but I'm trimming more and more to get there. Writing a draft of what I'll be saying helps too.

## Wellness

With the end of the year I think I got to 50% of the goals I set out to do. I didn't go swimming. My excuse is for not having the car most of the time however the truth is I could go to another on my bike.

Aside from these, I wanted to home gym and use the bike more. I did the last one. I've been replacing car trips of less than 5 Km with the bike to some success. I still need to ready it up for winter time but that's easy enough. And the soccer games have been a good way to get some exercise with either 1 or 2 games a week.

But for these past 2 weeks I didn't do much as I've had a cold.

This week I've had the opoortunity of talking for volkswagen internal summit about how we can ise SQL on our day to day. It was great to give a talk outside Porto and for sure I'll be looking into presenting another one this year. With that said I have a personal project that I'll be focusing on for the next weeks. I'm considering on using chatgpt4O as the basis. If all goes well it might be enough for a conference talk!

## Readings

ToDo: I'll update this section as soon as I have computer access (testing writing from the github app)

I've gotten focused on the presentation for VWDS as well as on reading a bit fantasy. The will of the many is a top contender for my book of the year.

## Goals

- Trim on the reading list 
- Deliver demo with gpto + UI

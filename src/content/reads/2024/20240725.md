#### [Spark-Connect: I'm starting to love it! | Sem Sinchenko by Sem Sinchenko](https://semyonsinchenko.github.io/ssinchenko/post/porting_deequ_to_sparkconnect/)

This article wasn't properly parsed by omnivore but the big takeaways:

- We can add plugins for extended functionality to our spark server
- Using spark connect we can implement any library in any language we want and send grpc requests to the server (spark connect server needs to be running)
- spark connect works on >3.5. Should be much better on v4.0
- If I truly want to be good in spark I eventually need to relearn scala/java
- Glue is cool but it's still on version 3.3. All these goodies will take too long to be implemented in glue

#### [So you got a null result. Will anyone publish it? by Kozlov, Max](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02383-9)

After reading the statistics books I can see much more clear the value of proving a null hypophesis, this is the feeling I am getting out of the academia. We are seeing more research without any any added value. Goodhart's law.

Sounds just like an airflow contender. with the plus of being able to run notebooks ðŸ¤”

#### [Simplify PySpark testing with DataFrame equality functions | Databricks Blog by Haejoon Lee, Allison Wang and Amanda Liu](https://www.databricks.com/blog/simplify-pyspark-testing-dataframe-equality-functions)

Good theme for a blog post on the changes of spark 4, this is really useful for human errors (been there multiple times)

#### [How to build a Semantic Layer in pieces: step-by-step for busy analytics engineers | dbt Developer Blog by Gwen Windflower](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/semantic-layer-in-pieces?ref=blef.fr)

So this will be generated on the fly as views by the semantic layer?, This looked neat until the moment I understood that the semantic layer requires dbt cloud

#### [Metaâ€™s approach to machine learning prediction robustness #### Engineering at Meta by Yijia Liu, Fei Tian, Yi Meng, Habiya Beg, Kun Jiang, Ritu Singh, Wenlin Chen, Peng Sun](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/07/10/data-infrastructure/machine-learning-ml-prediction-robustness-meta/)

Meta seems to be a couple of years ahead of the industry. The article doesn't provide a lot of insights but gives a feeling of their model evaluation being mostly automated + having a good AI debug tool

#### [Free-threaded CPython is ready to experiment with! | Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/free-threaded-python-rollout)

First step in a long way before we can get run python wihtout GIL. Interested on seeing if libraries like pandas will be able to leverage multithreading eventually with this

#### [Amazon DataZone introduces OpenLineage-compatible data lineage visualization in preview | AWS Big Data Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/amazon-datazone-introduces-openlineage-compatible-data-lineage-visualization-in-preview/)

Mixed feelings here. Great to see Open Lineage implemented at AWS. However it feels again that AWS just created the integration and wonâ€™t be driving the development of open lineage

#### [Unlocking Efficiency and Performance: Navigating the Spark 3 and EMR 6 Upgrade Journey at Slack - Slack Engineering by Nilanjana Mukherjee](https://slack.engineering/unlocking-efficiency-and-performance-navigating-the-spark-3-and-emr-6-upgrade-journey-at-slack/)

What could be improved to help this kind of migrations be done in a matter of days?, Livy might be deprecated in favor of spark connect. With their migration to Spark 3 and eventually 3.5 (not clear on this article) they could be interested in moving new jobs to connect , Basically solved issues by using the old behaviours. These will need to be migrated eventually. Would need to better understand these features , This looks like an important detail. With no explicit order spark can have random order of rows?, Cool to see these migrations and teams using open source solutions. EMR although expensive with a good engineering team can prove to be quite cost effective

#### [The Rise of the Data Platform Engineer - by Pedram Navid by Pedram Navid](https://databased.pedramnavid.com/p/the-rise-of-the-data-platform-engineer)

The need to define a data platform is something I see everywhere. It really looks like we are missing a piece here. Netflix maestro for example seems like a good contender for to solve the issue of (yet another data custom platform)

#### [Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) Pattern - by Julien Hurault by Julien Hurault](https://juhache.substack.com/p/write-audit-publish-wap-pattern?ref=blef.fr)

This articles brings me the question. Can we improve dbt by using WAP? How does the rollback mechanism work when a process fails?
